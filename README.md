# Welcome to my Assigment no.1 repository!


**Before starting:**

I'm **Cecilia** and across this repo you can find all the files I used for doing my first assignment of [STAT545](http://stat545.com/).

- On the **README.md** file you will find the *plain text* version of this file you are reading right now.

- The file **hw01_iris.md** contains an R Markdown document that explores the iris data frame in R. You can see it by typing the folowig line on your R console:
```R
iris
```
- Furthermore, trought this content you can find out:

	+ A brief description of this repo.
	
	+ An introduction about me:
		* Who I am?
		* Curious facts and more...

**Note:** This repo could be useful :+1: for you if you are interested in exploit some [**Github flavored markdown features**](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

1. My name is **Cecilia León**, and I'm from **México**. I'm an a passionate of **Statistics** and this September I'm starting the Master program at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/).

2. I'm an **actuary** of the National Autonomus University of México *(better known as [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/))*. I graduated on 2014, so I stopped study since 4 years ago! :scream: :speak_no_evil:

3. I worked two years at an entreprise called **GLAC consulting**, and along that time I acquired some experience about **social networks** data analysis and its impact on the social-wellbeing.

## Curious facts

1. I'm a big fan of **R**.

2. I love :coffee: but fur now I only can drink *decaf* :-1: 

3. I really like this quote:

> "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."
